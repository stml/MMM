MiniMonoMyth

MMM is a storytelling application for Weavrs.com

The narrative structure is based upon Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" AKA The Monomyth.

You can read about the concept on Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth

MMM will use Weavr's memories via the Weavr's API and any other 3rd party web service with an API.
